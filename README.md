# Mockup of the M. Asam products list and single product pages

It was developed fully using React. Due to strict time limits, I didn't implement all features and functionalities.
The responsive version of the menu is not fully functional â€” for example: none of the swiper components 
(image gallery, product tags and related products, to name a few) are present. The user reviews within the 
single product page were also not replicated.

It is completely responsive, although some of the responsivity features are not present yet (such as the filters and 
layout changes in general). 

The whole layout is data-driven, i.e., all of the content is input from the backend. Currently, it comes from static JS
objects that are passed through the Global Context.

The whole project took 4 days from start to finish, and resulted in a total of 5.236 lines of code. The biggest challenge
was sheer volume of work to be done. With some extra 4-7 days, it would likely be fully replicated and functioning.
